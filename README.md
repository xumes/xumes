# Hi, I'm Reginaldo 👋 	:man_technologist: 💻

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making code more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. 
Some technologies I enjoy working with include chatbots, the MERN (Mongo, Express, React and Node) stack and PHP. 

I am currently working on an awesome startup called <a href="https://www.proposify.com">Proposify</a>
