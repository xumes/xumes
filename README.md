# Hi, I'm Reginaldo 👋 	:man_technologist: 💻

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif" alt="banner git animated with some code scrolling on the screen">
I'm a senior software engineer who is passionate about making code more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. 
Some technologies I enjoy working with include chatbots, the MERN (Mongo, Express, React and Node) stack and PHP. 

I am currently working on an awesome company called <a href="https://www.redspace.com">REDspace</a>
